0,,snopes,,Finnish President Sauli Niinistö posted a video after his White House visit saying that he'd rather hang around reindeer than Donald Trump.,2019-10-07,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/president-finland-wh-video/,,,,"On Oct. 2, 2019, a joint press conference at the White House with U.S. President Donald Trump and President Sauli Niinistö of Finland spiraled out of control as reporters began questioning President Trump about a recent whistleblower complaint and an ongoing impeachment investigation. Shortly after the fiery media event, a video began circulating on social media which supposedly showed the Finnish president relaying a few of his thoughts about his White House visit:Finnish President recounts Oval Office meeting.

A number of internet users posted jokes and memes about the perceived political awkwardness at the media event, and CBS News reported of the event that:reportedPresident Trump dominated the headlines with a heated press conference, during which he called Congressman Adam Schiff a “lowlife,” doubled down on his attacks against the whistleblower, and threatened to sue several people. Caught in the crossfire between Mr. Trump and the reporters at the White House was the visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinistö, who spent much of the event sidelined beside Mr. Trump.Niinistö, however, emerged from the crucible to win praise for the way he handled it. And because Americans can’t resist using social media to express their feelings, Niinistö also got the meme treatment.“Finnish President doing a Jim from The Office,” one person wrote, referring to the mockumentary character’s signature stare into the camera — often used to say, without words, “I can’t believe what I’m witnessing right now,” or “get me out of here.”Finnish President doing a Jim from The Office#TrumpMeltdown pic.twitter.com/Ko4o4mxVLN— DogsHateBoots (@DogsHateBoots) October 2, 2019President Trump dominated the headlines with a heated press conference, during which he called Congressman Adam Schiff a “lowlife,” doubled down on his attacks against the whistleblower, and threatened to sue several people.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., was going smoothly until a woman in a black jacket stood up and started rambling her fears about apocalyptic climate change. Then she took her jacket off, revealing a T-shirt that read, “Save the planet. Eat the children.”T-shirtThe woman said she was glad Ocasio-Cortez supported the Green New Deal but stated it was not enough. “Your new campaign slogan has to be this,” she stated, taking her jacket off and revealing the shirt. “We got to start eating babies. We don’t have enough time. … Even if you would bomb Russia, we still have too many people, too much pollution!”Words and images from the event shared online prompted reactions from many, including U.S. President Donald Trump and his eldest son, Donald Jr.includingSeems like a normal AOC supporter to me. https://t.co/NWVMRD0wsl— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 4, 2019Seems like a normal AOC supporter to me. https://t.co/NWVMRD0wslhttps://t.co/NWVMRD0wsl— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 4, 2019October 4, 2019During the town hall, Ocasio-Cortez responded to the woman by talking about the need for positive solutions to climate change and concluding, “We are never beyond hope” before quickly moving on to another question.Although some on the political right criticized her response, Ocasio-Cortez followed up on Twitter by explaining that she had been operating under the assumption that the woman was mentally ill and in crisis.somerightThis person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it’s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse.

Be a decent human being and knock it off.— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 4, 2019October 4, 2019It turned out the woman in question was neither an Ocasio-Cortez supporter nor a person having a mental-health emergency but apparently acting at the behest of a group called Lyndon LaRouche PAC. The stunt was meant to troll Ocasio-Cortez.groupHistorian Matthew Sweet described the group as a “bizarre political cult” in an interview with The Washington Post about the incident. Sweet, who has studied the group’s history, told the Post that the woman’s stunt fell in line with their standard operating procedures. “The tactic,” Sweet told the Post, “is you go to a political meeting and you create a disturbance that disrupts the meeting, and more importantly, that creates a kind of chaos.”describedThe group, dubbed LaRouchians, has been around for decades, and was founded by conspiracy crank Lyndon LaRouche, who died in February 2019 at the age of 96 after building a “worldwide following based on conspiracy theories, economic doom, anti-Semitism, homophobia and racism.”buildingLaRouche’s conspiracy theories involve proffering claims that the Queen of England controls the international drug trade and that Adolf Hitler, whose forces bombed England in World War II, was a British agent.controlsagent",[],"[{""id"" : 645042"",""""begin"": 33,""end"": 46,""entity"": ""New York City"",""text"": ""New York City"",""score"": 0.40,""categories"" : [""New York

2,,snopes,,"A photograph shows a bride and groom during a """"Handmaid's Tale""""-themed wedding.",2019-10-04,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/handmaid-tale-themed-wedding/,,,,"In October 2019, a photograph supposedly showing a bride and groom surrounded by a group of “Handmaid’s Tale”-dressed bridesmaids in front of a “Hanging Wall” went viral on social media, with many people expressing shock that someone would use the popular dystopian novel as a basis for a themed wedding:viralThe picture stirred considerable controversy as it circulated online and left many people with questions. Before we get to the story behind this picture, let’s get some basic facts out of the way:This photograph was taken at Cambridge Mill, a restaurant and wedding venue in Ontario, Canada, that is also used as part of the set for the Hulu television series “The Handmaid’s Tale.” This photograph was taken in front of the “Hanging Wall” from the television show.  The handmaids were digitally inserted into this image by wedding photographers. The actual wedding was not “Handmaid’s Tale”-themed. This photograph was taken at Cambridge Mill, a restaurant and wedding venue in Ontario, Canada, that is also used as part of the set for the Hulu television series “The Handmaid’s Tale.” This photograph was taken in front of the “Hanging Wall” from the television show.  The handmaids were digitally inserted into this image by wedding photographers. The actual wedding was not “Handmaid’s Tale”-themed. This photograph was originally posted to the social media pages of Van Daele & Russell Photography and shows a couple identified only as Kendra and Torsten. Many viewers expressed “outrage” over the theme of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” a novel penned by Margaret Atwood in 1985 and later made into the Hulu show. The novel and show focus on a dystopian future in which fertile women, called handmaids, are subjected to brutal treatment and forced into child-bearing slavery. The hanging wall is a particular gruesome aspect of the show because it is where those who resist the rules of this new society are hanged. Van Daele & Russell PhotographyPhotographer Shawn Van Daele said the bride and groom are big fans of the “The Handmaid’s Tale.” And, since their wedding was being held at the same venue that doubles as a set for the show, they wanted a photograph of them in front of the hanging wall. Van Daele told Peta Pixel that he digitally added the handmaids after the photo shoot:Peta Pixel“The couple as well as ourselves are HUGE fans of the TV show (and obviously, first, the book). Anyone who would put out an image like this without understanding what it implies has bigger problems than upset people on social media,” Shawn tells PetaPixel. “I knew when creating the image that it would possibly upset people, but that’s sort of the point…to wake people up.”“The groom wanted photos on the ‘hanging wall,’ which is where we were taking their wedding photos; I joked about adding in some handmaids (since it seemed the natural thing to do since we were there … I’m certain any ‘creative’ or photographer would have the exact same thoughts),” continues Shawn. “We didn’t expect the photo to go viral, but we are SOOO HAPPY IT HAS because hopefully it will wake people up to how they too contribute to the oppression and hatred that they’re rightfully worked up over.”“The couple as well as ourselves are HUGE fans of the TV show (and obviously, first, the book). Anyone who would put out an image like this without understanding what it implies has bigger problems than upset people on social media,” Shawn tells PetaPixel. “I knew when creating the image that it would possibly upset people, but that’s sort of the point…to wake people up.”“The groom wanted photos on the ‘hanging wall,’ which is where we were taking their wedding photos; I joked about adding in some handmaids (since it seemed the natural thing to do since we were there … I’m certain any ‘creative’ or photographer would have the exact same thoughts),” continues Shawn. “We didn’t expect the photo to go viral, but we are SOOO HAPPY IT HAS because hopefully it will wake people up to how they too contribute to the oppression and hatred that they’re rightfully worked up over.”In sum, though this image will likely be the one most viewed from this couple’s wedding, they didn’t actually have a themed wedding based on the dystopian novel. The bride and groom are fans of the show and because the wedding was being held at Cambridge Mill, where part of the show is filmed, they decided to take at least one handmaid’s-themed photograph.have a themed weddingPeta Pixel reported:reportedIn the end, Shawn wants to remind people that this wasn’t “a ‘Handmaid’s Tale’ themed wedding,” it was their wedding day. One photo in a series of thousands from their wedding day that was intended mostly as a keepsake for them.“Everyone loves a good witch hunt …” laments Shawn. “Apparently today we are their witch.”In the end, Shawn wants to remind people that this wasn’t “a ‘Handmaid’s Tale’ themed wedding,” it was their wedding day.

4,,snopes,,"In September 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law a bill that provides $1.8 billion in funding for autism research and services.",2019-10-04,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-autism-1-8-billion/,,,,"We received multiple inquiries from readers in October 2019 about the accuracy of news reports that claimed U.S. President Donald Trump had signed legislation that would provide $1.8 billion in funding for autism-related programs and research. For example, on Oct. 2, ABC News published an article with the headline, “Trump Signs $1.8 Billion Autism Funding Bill” which reported that:article“President Donald Trump signed the Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education and Support Act (CARES) into law Monday, which allocates $1.8 billion in funding over the next five years to help people with autism spectrum disorder and their families … The funding, which backs autism research and autism-related support programs, will also prioritize grants for rural and underserved areas.”Various Fox-owned regional news channels published an article with the headline, “President Trump Signs Bill Providing $1.8 Billion in Funding for Autism Programs,” which reported that:newschannels“President Trump has signed a bill that allocates $1.8 billion in funding to help people on the autism spectrum. The Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education and Support (CARES) Act was signed into law Monday. The bill provides funding for autism programs and research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the Health Resources and Services Administration.“The bill, which reauthorizes the previous Autism CARES Act of 2014, expands government programs to include older people with autism ‘who were — and are– often misdiagnosed, underdiagnosed and overlooked,’ according to Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), one of the bill’s co-sponsors in the House of Representatives.”Those reports were accurate. On Sept. 30, Trump did indeed sign into law H.R. 1058, the Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education and Support Act of 2019, as the Congressional Record shows. The “Autism CARES Act” became law on that date. showsThe legislation, which was authored by U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., commits to spending $369.7 million every fiscal year between 2020 and 2024 — a total of $1.85 billion over five years. As such, the news articles were also highly accurate in reporting that the bill Trump signed allocates $1.8 billion. In fact, the total is slightly higher. commitsThat funding commitment represents a 42 percent increase on the $1.3 billion that Congress allocated for 2015-2019, in the 2014 Autism CARES Act. The bill had sponsors from both parties and received wide bipartisan support in both houses. It was passed without need for a roll-call vote in the House on July 24 and in the Senate on Sept. 19.HouseSenateThe bill essentially reauthorized the Autism CARES Act of 2014, which had been sponsored by Smith in the House, and Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., in the Senate. It provided funding for the disbursement of grants to researchers, as well as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) programs and centers across the country.2014Former President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on Aug. 8, 2014. The 2019 bill added new provisions whereby the Director of the National Institutes of Health could prioritize funding for research, programs and services in “rural or underserved areas,” and take into account the extent to which an applicant served “youth and adults from diverse racial, ethnic, geographic, or linguistic backgrounds.”provisionsIn the past, President Trump has repeatedly promoted the long-debunked theory that vaccinations cause autism, but his position may have shifted somewhat. Earlier in 2019, he urged parents to vaccinate their children against measles, in the midst of an outbreak of the disease. urged",[],"[{""id"" : 4848272"",""""begin"": 121,""end"": 133,""entity"":

While Clinton would eventually be impeached on charges such as “making false and misleading statements to potential grand jury witnesses,” this fake tweet is commenting on a bluntly (and incorrectly) boiled-down version of Clinton’s impeachment.impeachmentThis tweet does not appear on Lewinsky’s official Twitter timeline. We also searched a cached version of her page to see if the tweet had recently been deleted, but came up empty there, as well. timelineWhile we found a number of people sharing this message, they all did so by posting a text version of this message or by posting the above-displayed screenshot. We were unable to find any instances of a person retweeting the actual tweet link, nor any links to a genuine message that was recently deleted. actualThis tweet is also suspicious because the image indicates it was sent with “Twitter for Android.” Lewinksy’s tweets, however, are most often sent via iPhone. iPhoneThis fake tweet appears to have been created by the @electorotting (notice watermark in upper right-hand corner of image), an Instagram page that frequently posts political memes and jokes. While the account occasionally shares genuine posts from political leaders (Sen. Lindsey Graham truly once posted on Twitter “If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed … and we will deserve it”), the fake tweets shared by @electorotting all appear to be marked with the social media page’s watermark.  InstagramsharesSen.

6,,snopes,,NASA and NOAA faked climate data in the GISTEMP global temperature record to exaggerate global warming.,2019-10-03,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/global-warming-data-faked/,,,,"Since 2014, climate-change deniers have squeezed millions of views, Facebook shares, and Twitter retweets by retelling a story alleging the discovery of “faked” NASA data designed to “fit a climate change narrative.” Though copied almost wholesale from a blog post, the version of the story that has had the most online traction was published on the one-stop conspiracy theory/supplement shop that goes by the name Natural News. The article suggested:squeezedblog postsuggestedIn what might be the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered, NASA and the NOAA have been caught red-handed altering historical temperature data to produce a “climate change narrative” that defies reality. […] We now know that historical temperature data for the continental United States were deliberately altered by NASA and NOAA scientists in a politically-motivated attempt to rewrite history and claim global warming is causing U.S. temperatures to trend upward.In what might be the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered, NASA and the NOAA have been caught red-handed altering historical temperature data to produce a “climate change narrative” that defies reality. […] We now know that historical temperature data for the continental United States were deliberately altered by NASA and NOAA scientists in a politically-motivated attempt to rewrite history and claim global warming is causing U.S. temperatures to trend upward.There is a lot to unpack here, but the first thing you need to know is records of global surface temperatures are constantly refined based on the addition of new data, fresh statistical analyses, or new historical insight into the history of a specific source of data. Reporting on such a shift as something to “uncover” betrays a potentially willful ignorance of how climate science operates. These changes are publicly reported, based on stated scientific criteria, and subjected to rigorous internal and external peer review.constantly refinedWhere is this coming from?The “smoking gun” concerns a climate record known as the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP). These records are based on a massive global dataset of temperature stations from around the world, combining several collections of data originally collected by individual weather stations. The record provides “a measure of the changing global surface temperature with monthly resolution for the period since 1880, when a reasonably global distribution of meteorological stations was established.”GISTEMPprovidesTo argue for evidence of “faked” data, Natural News, as well as the original blog post, highlighted a version of the GISTEMP record for the United States first published in 1999, comparing it to one published later, in 2012. The record, these sources point out, has shifted:(These charts plot how far off each year’s average U.S. temperature differs from the average temperature for the entire period 1951–1980; the frame labeled “a” is from 1999.)chartsIt should be no shock that the data shifted following 1999, as illustrated graphically in the above diagram, because NASA published multiple papers in 1999 and 2001 about these changes and why they were made. Links to these papers can be found on the NASA website, which also publicly summarizes the changes in several other places.multiplepapers summarizesWhy adjust climate data?Writing for the climate information website Skeptical Science, Berkeley Earth research scientist Zeke Hausfather, whose work (in part) independently analyzes adjustments made by government agencies’ climate records, explained the need for making adjustments to such datasets in general. A primary misconception, he argues, is that an “unadjusted global temperature record” — which necessarily has to take into account not only the temperature reading at a given recording station, but also how to translate that data spatially to come up with a single annual or monthly number — is not really a thing that exists to begin with:Zeke HausfatherexplainedThere are a number of folks who question the need for adjustments at all. Why not just use raw temperatures, they ask, since those are pure and unadulterated? The problem is that … there is really no such thing as a pure and unadulterated temperature record. Temperature stations in the U.S. are mainly operated by volunteer observers (the Cooperative Observer Network, or co-op stations for short). Many of these stations were set up in the late 1800s and early 1900s as part of a national network of weather stations, focused on measuring day-to-day changes in the weather rather than decadal-scale changes in the climate.Nearly every single station in the network in the network has been moved at least once over the last century, with many having 3 or more distinct moves. Most of the stations have changed [the type of instruments used]. Observation times have shifted from afternoon to morning at most stations since 1960, as part of an effort by the National Weather Service to improve precipitation measurements.There are a number of folks who question the need for adjustments at all.

Observation times have shifted from afternoon to morning at most stations since 1960, as part of an effort by the National Weather Service to improve precipitation measurements.So what were the issues that led to changes between the 1999 record and the later record? According to NASA’s GISTEMP website, “Starting in the 1990s, the methodology took into account documented non-climatic biases in the raw data and eliminated or corrected unrealistic outliers.” The goal of these adjustments is to remove shoddy data from the dataset using pre-established methodologies, not to fit a “climate change narrative.”AccordingThese “non-climatic biases” include things like stations taking temperature measurements at different times of day, stations physically moving locations (sometimes to a different elevation), and other artifacts that produce change in a record not attributable to climate or weather. These non-climatic biases were identified and their method of adjustment described in a publicly available 2001 paper found, among other places, on NASA’s website. They included:includedTime of observation: Not all stations collect observations at the same time, and some stations — most significantly in the United States — have changed the time at which data is collected over time. Correcting for these effects is the most significant adjustment made to the GISTEMP dataset post-1999.Station location history: Sometimes stations move to another location, affecting the record. Post-1999 records take this into account.Change in thermometer type: A well-defined shift in data came from a change from liquid-in-glass thermometers to the maximum-minimum temperature system (MMTS). Post-1999 records take this into account.Urban heat effect: Densely populated urban areas retain heat more than rural areas. An increase in stations in urban areas over time, for example, would create a false warming trend. Post 1999 records take this into account as well.Time of observation: Not all stations collect observations at the same time, and some stations — most significantly in the United States — have changed the time at which data is collected over time.

The methods used and their effect on the data are all disclosed online. However the issues described above are largely moot at the time of this writing in 2019. The GISTEMP analyses at issue above concern a formulation of the dataset (GISTEMP v3) that has been replaced by an improved model named GISTEMP v4, which includes a much larger set of data and a whole other set of adjustments.employ modelsGISTEMP v4“Caught red-handed”All told, the most significant effect of all these changes came from the time-of-day adjustments. Collectively, the adjustments served to produce a slightly increased warming trend in the United States record compared to the earlier records.warming trendThe largest adjustments are the time of observation debiasing and station history adjustment, each of which increases the mean warming over the United States by about 0.15ºC over the 100 years. The net of all five adjustments to the … record is a warming of about 0.3ºCThe largest adjustments are the time of observation debiasing and station history adjustment, each of which increases the mean warming over the United States by about 0.15ºC over the 100 years. The net of all five adjustments to the … record is a warming of about 0.3ºCTo suggest — 14 years after the fact — that identifying publicly discussed adjustments to raw data whose methods have been published in peer-reviewed journals represents catching scientists “red-handed” in “the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered” exposes only the ignorance of the author, not some nefarious sleight of hand by climate scientists. As such, the claim is rated “False.”",[],"[{""id"" : 7529378"",""""begin"": 65,""end"": 73,""entity"": ""Facebook"",""text"": ""Facebook"",""score"": 0.37,""categories"" : [""Facebook"",""Android

7,,snopes,,"In September 2019, U.S. House Democrats voted for a bill that would create an electronic health record system for immigrants on the southern border which does not yet exist for military veterans.",2019-10-03,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dems-immigrants-vets-health/,,,,"In September and October 2019, we received multiple inquiries about the accuracy of news reports that claimed U.S. House Democrats had voted in favor of an electronic health records (EHR) system for undocumented immigrants at the southern border with Mexico, while also rejecting a similar system for U.S. military veterans. On Sept. 28, the right-leaning Western Journal website published an article with the headline “Dems Vote to Enhance Med Care for Illegals Now, Vote Down Vets Waiting 10 Years for Same Service.” The article reported that:Western Journal“House Democrats voted Thursday to fast-track an electronic medical records system that would serve illegal immigrants, something America’s veterans have been seeking for years … The Democratic proposal would require the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol to create an Electronic Health Record system … The bill gives the DHS 90 days after the bill receives final approval to get the job done. In contrast, the Veterans Administration has been working for years to implement an EHR system for veterans.”The article was given wider exposure when it was tweeted out by former Arkansas governor and Republican presidential primary candidate Mike Huckabee, who added: “Before Dems headed home to mingle with forgotten [people] who sent them to DC, they passed bill to fast-track an electronic medical records system for illegal immigrants but voted down a GOP plan to provide same for veterans, who have to wait 10 yrs for it.”Before Dems headed home to mingle with forgotten ppl who sent them to DC, they passed bill to fast-track an electronic medical records system for illegal immigrants but voted down a GOP plan to provide same for veterans, who have to wait 10 yrs for it.https://t.co/6C3xCxbNZj— Gov.

Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) September 30, 2019September 30, 2019In a similar vein, the website Chicks on the Right published an article with the headline, “Dems Vote to Give Illegal Aliens Better Healthcare System Than What’s at the VA or DoD.” That post claimed that:article“Democrats flexed the true might of their majority in the House on Thursday when they voted to give illegal immigrants living in the United States an electronic medical records system that is better than the one currently being used at the Veterans Affairs Administration or the Department of Defense.”In support of the claim that House Democrats had rejected the opportunity to propose the same EHR system for veterans as it was proposing for immigrants, Western Journal cited comments made by Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn. In a tweet, Burchett wrote, “Amendment to give veterans same healthcare as illegals fails. Are you kidding me?”In an accompanying video, Burchett said the bill had related to “providing healthcare benefits to illegal aliens,” adding “When the Republicans attempted to put an amendment on there that made it so that our veterans would receive the same benefits, oddly enough they voted against that amendment …”Amendment to give VETERANS same healthcare as ILLEGALS fails.

Mark Walker, R-N.C., writing:The claims made by Western Journal, Huckabee, Burchett, Chicks on the Right, and Walker were largely inaccurate and grossly misleading.AnalysisAn EHR system already exists for veteransAn EHR system already exists for veteransIn reality, an electronic health record system (EHR) already exists for veterans in the U.S., and has done so for years. What House Republicans alluded to were improvements to that system, scheduled to be implemented over the next decade, whose delays in implementation have proven controversial.already existsimprovementsscheduledcontroversialThe enhanced, modernized, updated EHR system for veterans and serving military members is not the same as the comparatively rather basic EHR system being proposed, for the first time, for immigrants stopped at the U.S. border.  is not the sameWhat the immigrant bill actually proposedWhat the immigrant bill actually proposedA bill passed by the House on Sept. 26 (H.R. 3525) proposed introducing an EHR system related to immigrants stopped crossing into the United States, but it did not propose giving them any specific “healthcare benefits,” as Burchett falsely claimed. It certainly did not propose a “better healthcare system” or better EHR system for immigrants stopped at the border than currently exists in relation to serving military personnel or military veterans, as Chicks on the Right falsely claimed. H.R. 3525The full text of the legislation, introduced by Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-Ill., can be read here. Roughly speaking, it proposes two innovations: here“Comprehensive medical screening of individuals, particularly children, pregnant women, the elderly, and other vulnerable populations, interdicted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection between ports of entry”“An electronic health record system that can be accessed by all departmental components operating along the borders of the United States for individuals in the custody of such components.”“Comprehensive medical screening of individuals, particularly children, pregnant women, the elderly, and other vulnerable populations, interdicted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection between ports of entry”“An electronic health record system that can be accessed by all departmental components operating along the borders of the United States for individuals in the custody of such components.”What House Republicans proposed (and Democrats rejected)What House Republicans proposed (and Democrats rejected)The Republican proposal that Democrats rejected during the course of the debate would not have provided veterans what was proposed, in Underwood’s bill, for immigrants crossing the border. That claim, as made by Burchett and Huckabee, was false for two reasons.First, an EHR system already exists for veterans, so veterans therefore already have what the bill proposed for immigrants. Second, the Republican proposal did not actually propose any services, whether new services or an expansion of existing services, for veterans. Rather, it proposed delaying the implementation of the immigrant EHR system until 2027, the date on which the roll out of the new, improved veterans EHR system is expected to be completed. Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., introduced the “motion to recommit” (to send the bill back to the Homeland Security committee for reconsideration), which included the 2027 delay proposal. From the floor of the House, Green said:Despite improvements in the VA electronic health record system, problems and delays still remain … The very benefits that Congresswoman Underwood, in this bill, advances for illegal aliens flooding across our southern border — our veterans don’t have those benefits. Let me say that again. This bill, without the amendment I’m asking this body to consider, advances healthcare services to illegal aliens, before it does our American heroes.The VA secretary testified before Congress that it will take his department 10 years to fully deploy this new system … This timelines states that our veterans will not get an interoperable electronic health record [system] at all VA facilities until September 20, 2027 … All this amendment does is ensure our veterans get this service first. If you vote against this motion to recommit, you are giving an electronic medical health record [system] to illegal aliens, before our veterans. Despite improvements in the VA electronic health record system, problems and delays still remain … The very benefits that Congresswoman Underwood, in this bill, advances for illegal aliens flooding across our southern border — our veterans don’t have those benefits. Let me say that again. This bill, without the amendment I’m asking this body to consider, advances healthcare services to illegal aliens, before it does our American heroes.The VA secretary testified before Congress that it will take his department 10 years to fully deploy this new system … This timelines states that our veterans will not get an interoperable electronic health record [system] at all VA facilities until September 20, 2027 … All this amendment does is ensure our veterans get this service first. If you vote against this motion to recommit, you are giving an electronic medical health record [system] to illegal aliens, before our veterans.   That claim was false. As we have explained already, the VA has had an EHR system for years, as Green himself acknowledged just moments earlier, when he said “despite improvements in the VA electronic health record system, problems and delays still remain.”If Green and others were to propose that, as a matter of principle, Congress ought to implement the new and improved VA EHR system before it creates any EHR system for immigrants detained along the southern border, that would be a subjective value judgment to which nobody could pose any factual objection.new and improvedanyHowever, the specific and explicit factual claim made by Green and others was that Underwood’s bill would provide, in the context of immigrants detained at the border, an EHR system that does not yet exist for veterans, and will not fully exist until 2027. That claim was false. The only accurate element in the foregoing news articles and pronouncements was the claim that House Democrats had introduced a bill that would create an EHR system relating to immigrants detained along the southern border. As such, we issue a rating of “Mostly False.”",[],"[{""id"" : 58236"",""""begin"": 761,""end"": 792,""entity"": ""United States Department of Homeland Security"",""text"": ""Department of Homeland

8,,snopes,,"U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff is """"linked"""" to a Ukrainian arms dealer.",2019-10-03,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/adam-schiff-ukrainian/,,,,"A smear piece targeting U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff swept a California businessman and engineer into the mix and, in doing so, potentially endangered his child. On Sept. 29, 2019, the right-leaning website The Gateway Pundit posted a story headlined, “EXPLOSIVE REPORT: Rep. Adam Schiff Linked to Prominent Ukrainian Arms Dealer!” The purported “arms dealer” in the story is Igor Pasternak, who is neither a prominent arms dealer nor a Ukrainian.right-leaningIgor PasternakSoon after the Gateway Pundit story was published, Fox News primetime host Laura Ingraham boosted the same narrative on her own widely watched program. Both outlets were lashing out in defense of U.S. President Donald Trump, who is facing an impeachment inquiry spearheaded by Schiff, a Democrat from California who chairs the House Intelligence Committee.boostedTrump is accused of using his office to obtain damaging information on a political rival from the Ukrainian government. Thus both The Gateway Pundit and Ingraham attempted to make the case that Schiff had equally inappropriate dealings with Ukraine. But the story is thin, based entirely on the fact that Pasternak, an engineer and business owner, hosted a fundraiser for Schiff in 2013.Fox News falsely reported that Pasternak “moved his corporation into [Schiff’s] California district” and stated without proof that Schiff “could have” traded political favors for campaign donations. Pasternak’s company, Worldwide Aeros Corp, is based in Montebello, California, and is not in Schiff’s Congressional district (Pasternak’s district is the 38th, represented by Linda Sanchez). Pasternak, who spoke to us by phone, said neither Fox nor The Gateway Pundit reached out to him for his side of the story.The Gateway Pundit story claims Pasternak “sold arms in places like Syria” and “has also been connected to [billionaire philanthropist] George Soros.” This is a laughable fantasy, Pasternak said.“It’s not like stretching of the truth or a misrepresent the facts,” Pasternak told us. “It just has nothing to do with reality.”It’s also not a new narrative. The same story floated in 2018 on a different website, that time in response to a memo authored by Schiff detailing Russian meddling in the 2016 election. different websitePasternak did host a fundraiser for Schiff in 2013, but he told us he has donated to multiple politicians, both Democratic and Republican, a statement that can be confirmed by searching his name on the government transparency tool Open Secrets. And he did design some military hardware, including small arms and surveillance equipment, which were used by the Ukrainian military in that country’s conflict with Russian forces.Open SecretsBut his company’s main occupation is the manufacture of airships, also known as lighter-than-air aircraft. Furthermore, Pasternak was raised in Ukraine but was born in Kazakhstan. He is also an American citizen. His mother tongue is Russian, he told us. He doesn’t speak Ukrainian.Pasternak took The Gateway Pundit’s smear against him in stride, joking that the website had publicized “the best picture of me.”But what attracted his concern was that the story included a collage of images, some of which Pasternak believes were taken from his Facebook account. In that collage were not only pictures of his young son but the boy’s name. The story also contained the family’s home address. The information has been posted by various troll accounts on social media, prompting Pasternak to contact authorities.“It really to me is not a joke,” Pasternak told us. “If it was just me, then OK, thank you for publicizing my best picture.” But Pasternak, who like Soros is Jewish, read it in a threatening light, noting the collage contained more images of his child than of him. “They clearly understand he’s the most vulnerable point for me.”Soros, whose foundation donates money to progressive causes, is the frequent target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.targetPasternak said he didn’t make any money off the equipment sent to the Ukrainian military and elected to do so after becoming emotionally moved while visiting Maidan square shortly after deadly clashes with protesters and police in 2014. Pasternak said it’s possible he has been the target of disinformation because his pro-Ukraine activities in the face of Ukraine’s conflict with Russia got him on “Putin’s bad list.”Since at least 2014, the Russians have harnessed social media in the U.S. to spread disinformation to influence public opinion, a technique they deployed in their 2016 U.S. election-interference operation.harnessedWe reached out to Gateway Pundit founder Jim Hoft, asking why the story on his website included the identity and photograph of an uninvolved child, but received no response. Although we normally link to stories we fact check, we chose not to do so in this case because the Pundit story identifies a child and contains his picture and address.",[],"[{""id"" :

The same networks that wailed for hours about the inhumanity of illegal migrant “kids in cages” had no interest in something a thousandfold more horrific.In a tweet promoting the article, Life News also claimed that these outlets “haven’t run a single word about the abortionist” and then added: “Shame on you for censoring the truth about the brutality of abortion.”tweetThese outlets are not “censoring” this story, nor did they “refuse” to cover it. In reality, ABC, NBC, NPR, CBS Chicago, and WTTW (Chicago’s PBS station) have all published stories about this disturbing discovery:NBC News on September 13: “Thousands of fetal remains found at Illinois property that belonged to abortion doctor.”ABC News on September 20: “Patient records found at shuttered Indiana abortion clinics.”NPR on September 19: “Fate Of Fetal Remains Unclear As Investigation Continues In Indiana.”WTTW (Chicago PBS) on September 19: “Indiana, Illinois AGs Investigate After Fetal Remains Found.”CBS Chicago on September 14: “‘No One Has Any Answers’: Attorney Speaks For Family Of Abortion Doctor Who Left Thousands Of Fetal Remains On His Property After He Died.”NBC News on September 13: “Thousands of fetal remains found at Illinois property that belonged to abortion doctor.”NBC News on September 13: “Thousands of fetal remains found at Illinois property that belonged to abortion doctor.”ABC News on September 20: “Patient records found at shuttered Indiana abortion clinics.”ABC News on September 20: “Patient records found at shuttered Indiana abortion clinics.”NPR on September 19: “Fate Of Fetal Remains Unclear As Investigation Continues In Indiana.”NPR on September 19: “Fate Of Fetal Remains Unclear As Investigation Continues In Indiana.”WTTW (Chicago PBS) on September 19: “Indiana, Illinois AGs Investigate After Fetal Remains Found.”WTTW (Chicago PBS) on September 19: “Indiana, Illinois AGs Investigate After Fetal Remains Found.”CBS Chicago on September 14: “‘No One Has Any Answers’: Attorney Speaks For Family Of Abortion Doctor Who Left Thousands Of Fetal Remains On His Property After He Died.”CBS Chicago on September 14: “‘No One Has Any Answers’: Attorney Speaks For Family Of Abortion Doctor Who Left Thousands Of Fetal Remains On His Property After He Died.”We found no mention of this story, however, on MSNBC.com or CBSnews.com.MSNBC.comCBSnews.comThe Life News article, which was originally published on Newsbusters under the less sensational title “Bozell & Graham Column: Abortion Horrors Buried by the Press,” is attempting to comment on the fact that the story of Klopfer received little attention on national television news broadcasts. And that is true. We searched for mentions of Klopfer on TV Eyes and, as of Oct. 3, 2019, found the vast majority of coverage on this case came from local news outlets. NewsbustersHowever, Life News’ coverage of this critique is severely misleading. The website claimed that these outlets were “refusing” to cover this story, attempting to “censor” the truth, and that they had failed to “run a single word about the abortionist.”  But, as one can see above, that isn’t the case. Many of the aforementioned outlets did provide coverage of this story, even if it was only on their websites. If ABC, NBC, or NPR were truly trying to “censor” the truth about this abortionist, they probably wouldn’t publish news stories about it on their sites.It should also be noted that Life News’ claim that these outlets “refused” to cover this story is based on little more than an absence of broadcast coverage. Life News provides no evidence (and makes no attempt to do so) to show that anyone in charge of the networks actively forbade reporters from covering the story. Simply not covering a story, of course, is not the same as refusing to cover a story. refusingNews outlets, especially newspapers with limited space and television news outlets with limited airtime, continuously make decisions about which stories to cover in order to best serve their audiences. PBS News points to five criteria that journalists consider when determining if a story is newsworthy: Timeliness, proximity, conflict and controversy, human interest, and relevance.PBS NewsAs this discovery was made in Illinois and involved a doctor who performed abortions in Indiana, this story has received a lot of local news coverage from outlets in these states. National news outlets, however, have to serve a national audience and decide what to cover from a wider pool of reporting. The fact that this story did not make it to prime time national television doesn’t necessarily mean these outlets “refused” to cover it, just that other stories were deemed more worthy of airtime. While Life News may have a point when it argues this story deserved more national coverage, claiming these outlets “refused” to cover the story, wanted to “censor” the truth, and failed to
