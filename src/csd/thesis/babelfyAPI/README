README - Babelfy API 1.0 (April 2015)

This package consists of a Java API to work with Babelfy, a unified,
multilingual, graph-based approach to Entity Linking and Word Sense
Disambiguation. For more information please refer to the documentation
below on how to install and run the software, as well as our website
(http://babelfy.org) for news, updates and papers.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

We assume that you have a standard installation of the Sun Java 1.7 JDK
and all the associated programs (i.e., java, javac, etc.) in your path.

INSTALLATION

**************
1 Babelfy API
**************

In order to access Babelfy RESTFul service, it is necessary to specify a
valid key using the "babelfy.key" property in the config/babelfy.var.properties
file. To obtain a key, please register on http://babelnet.org/register.

You are now ready to use the API. For testing purposes we 
provide a shell script:

		Linux:   run-babelnetdemo.sh, make sure that the file is 
			executable by running: chmod +x run-babelnetdemo.sh.
		Windows: run-babelnetdemo.bat

******************************************************
1.1 Configuring Babelfy API within an Eclipse project
******************************************************

1) Create your Eclipse project (File -> New -> Java (or Scala) project,
   give the project a name and press Finish). This creates a new folder
   with the project name under your Eclipse workspace folder
2) Copy the config/ folder from the Babelfy-online-API-1.0 folder into
   your workspace/projectFolder/
3) Now we need to include all the lib/*.jar and babelfy-online-1.0.jar files 
   in the project build classpath:
   a) Select the project from Package Explorer tree view
   b) From the top bar click on Project and then Properties
   c) Once inside the Properties section click on Java build path and
      select the Libraries tab
   d) From the right menu click on the Add External JARs button
   e) Browse to the downloaded Babelfy-online-API-1.0 folder, and select all the
      lib/*.jar and babelfy-online-1.0.jar files
4) Next we need to Include the config/ folder in the project build
   classpath:
   a) Select the project from Package Explorer tree view
   b) From the top bar click on File and then Refresh
   c) From the Java build path (see point 3 above) select the Source tab
   d) Once in the Source tab, click on Add Folder from the right sidebar
      and select the downloaded config/ folder
5) Happy coding!! ;-)
